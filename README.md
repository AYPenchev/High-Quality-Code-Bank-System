# High Quality Code - Bank System
C# project for Sofia University

This project was made for High Quality Code course.
It represents a Bank system which allows the bank
that is using the system to have multiple clients
(Individuals and Companies). Each client can have multiple
bank accounts (Deposit account, Loan account, Mortgage account)

- Deposit account allows you to:
    1. Make deposit
    2. Withdraw
    3. Get the interest rate for a given amount of months
    4. Get the balance of your account

- Loan account allows you to:
    1. Make deposit
    2. Get the interest rate for a given amount of months
    3. Get the balance of your account

- Mortgage account allows you to:
    1. Make deposit
    2. Get the interest rate for a given amount of months
    3. Get the balance of your account

- Individuals and Companies have almost the same functionality 
the difference is that Individual have personal ID number and
Companies have company number

In the project unit tests and exceptions are used to ensure
that no mistakes happen, after all the system works with money.
Also this project is build following OOP and SOLID principles
and for version control git and gihub.
